# Football-Analysis-system-usiing-Machine-Learning-and-Python
The AI/ML Football Analysis System utilizes YOLO for object detection to track players, referees, and footballs in match footage. Kmeans clustering classifies players into teams based on jersey colors, allowing the calculation of ball possession percentages. Optical flow compensates for camera movement, ensuring accurate player tracking, while perspective transformation converts pixel distances into real-world measurements like meters. The system also computes key metrics such as player speed, distance covered, and ball acquisition rates, providing valuable insights for teams, analysts, and fans. This project integrates computer vision, machine learning, and sports analytics to enhance football performance analysis.
